# Contribution guideline

You are encouraged to contribute to the repository by forking and submitting a pull request.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a basic tutorial and check out a more detailed guide to pull requests.)

Pull requests will be evaluated by the repository guardians on a schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the main branch. Pull requests should have a descriptive name and include an summary of all changes made in the pull request description.

If you would like to propose a significant change, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes with the community and to avoid re-work.

Contributions are made pursuant to the Developer's Certificate of Origin, available at https://developercertificate.org, and licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0 (Apache-2.0).
