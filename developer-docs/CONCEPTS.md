# Concepts

The concepts section of the documentation is meant to give a high-level explanation of the central concepts of framework. Examples of concepts that may be explained here are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Genesis Transactions, etc.

The purpose of these explanations is not to give the reader a full understanding of these concepts, but to offer them enough knowledge of these concepts so they can work with the framework. This is important, because it keeps the documentation concise and understandable to newcomers. That being said, you are encouraged to offer the reader a more advanced description of these concepts by referencing external materials such as relevant RFCs, standards and other material.
