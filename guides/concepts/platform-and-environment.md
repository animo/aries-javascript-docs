# Platform and Environment

[Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts) is developed to support a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) environment. With this it is entirely possible to build an entire SSI ecosystem with Credo. This would use Node.js as an issuer as a verifier, and uses React Native as a holder.
