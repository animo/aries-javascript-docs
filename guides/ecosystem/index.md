# The Credo Ecosystem

The Credo ecosystem includes various components that are spread across multiple repositories. In this section we'll go over what these components are and how the relate to one another.

## Repositories

Currently, Credo is composed out of two separate repositories:

1. [Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts)
2. [Credo Extensions](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts-ext)

In addition, there are several open-source applications and building blocks built on top of Credo. One example is [Aries Mobile Agent React Native (Bifold)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native), which is a white-label mobile wallet you can use to bootstrap your own custom wallet.

## Documentation

You can find their documentation here:

1. [Credo (core)](https://credo.js.org/guides)
2. [Credo Extensions](https://credo.js.org/guides/extensions)

### Developer Contributions

Each project maintains its own CONTRIBUTING guidance:

Each project has a significant set of developer conventions, checklists, templates, and actions to provide guidance and boundaries for a contribution.
Consider looking at previous issues and their corresponding PRs to get a sense of the latest.
