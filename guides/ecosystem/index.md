# The Credo Ecosystem

The Credo ecosystem includes various components that are spread across multiple repositories. In this section we'll go over what these components are and how the relate to one another.

## Repositories

Currently, Credo is composed out of three separate repositories:

1. [Credo](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript)
2. [Credo Extensions](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext)
3. [Aries Mobile Agent React Native (Bifold)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native)

## Documentation

You can find their documentation here:

1. [Credo](https://credo.js.org/guides)
2. [Credo Extensions](https://credo.js.org/guides/extensions)
3. [Aries Mobile Agent React Native (Bifold)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/blob/main/README.md)

### Credo

Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) is at the core of the Credo ecosystem. AFJ provides all the functionality related to cryptography, storage, messaging and more that is required

### Developer Contributions

Each project maintains its own CONTRIBUTING guidance:

- [AFJ CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [AFJ-Ext CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Aries Bifold CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING)

Each project has a significant set of developer conventions, checklists, templates, and actions to provide guidance and boundaries for a contribution.
Consider looking at previous issues and their corresponding PRs to get a sense of the latest.
