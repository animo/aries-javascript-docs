# Extensions

Credo Extensions is an extensions repository to Credo. It hosts libraries built on top of Credo that don't necessarily belong to the core of the project.

Currently, there are four packages in the extension repository. Example extension libraries include React Hooks for AFJ and a REST API wrapper.
