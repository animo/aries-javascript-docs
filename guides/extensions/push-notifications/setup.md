# Setup

Make sure you have set up the correct version of Aries Framework JavaScript according to the AFJ repository. To find out which version of AFJ you need to have installed you can run the following command. This will list the required peer dependency for `@aries-framework/core`.

```sh
npm info "@aries-framework/push-notifications" peerDependencies
```

Then add the `push-notifications` plugin to your project.

```sh
yarn add @aries-framework/push-notifications
```
