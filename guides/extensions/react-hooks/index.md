# React Hooks for Aries Framework JavaScript

The `react-hooks` package exposes useful React hooks that allow you to easily interact with AFJ.

Everything exported from React Hooks:

```ts
import AgentProvider, {
  useAgent,
  useConnections,
  useConnectionById,
  useConnectionByState,
  useCredentials,
  useCredentialById,
  useCredentialByState,
  useProofs,
  useProofById,
  useProofByState,
} from '@aries-framework/react-hooks'
```

These hooks provide a simple way to query agent data in a client application using React.
