# Setup

To use the `react-hooks` package, you need to have set up the correct version of Aries Framework JavaScript according to the AFJ repository (See `Getting Started` section in the sidebar).

To find out which version of AFJ you need to have installed you can run the following command. This will list the required peer dependency for `@aries-framework/core`.

```sh
npm info "@aries-framework/react-hooks" peerDependencies
```

## Installation

To add the `react-hooks` package to your project (after completing the setup step above), simply run:

```sh
yarn add @aries-framework/react-hooks
```
