# Aries Framework JavaScript Redux Store

Aries Framework JavaScript Redux Store is a wrapper around [Aries Framework JavaScript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript.git) (AFJ), built with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). It provides a implementation of state management that can be used to build React & React Native SSI clients using AFJ.

The Redux Store provides a simple implementation of state management for the most important parts of using AFJ in a client application (mediation, connections, credentials and proofs), allowing you to sync UI state with the state of the agent as it interacts with other agents through the framework.
