# Platform and Environment

[Aries framework
JavaScript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript) is
developed to support a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [React
Native](https://reactnative.dev) environment. With this it is entirely possible
to build an entire SSI ecosystem with [Aries Framework
JavaScript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript). This
would use [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) as an issuer as a verifier, and uses
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) as a holder.

> TODO: do we want to give a setup guide for both environments? React Native
> might be very difficult with the indy-sdk.

> TODO: How do we want to handle platform setup? We can do setup indy-sdk and
> requirements for NodeJS and link to React Native dev setup.
