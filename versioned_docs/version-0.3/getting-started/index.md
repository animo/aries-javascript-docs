# Getting started

In this section we will go over everything you need to get started on a technical level. First there are specific installation guides for NodeJS and React Native. Aries JavaScript works for creating both server-side application (commonly but not always issuer and verifier) and mobile applications (commonly holder apps). Depending on your use case you can follow the installation guides for [NodeJS](./installation/nodejs/index.md), [React Native](./installation/react-native/index.md), or both.

After the installation of your prerequisites is complete, we'll walk you through the [initial setup](./set-up/index.md) of the framework.
