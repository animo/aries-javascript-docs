# Platform and Environment

[Aries framework JavaScript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript) is developed to support a [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) environment. With this it is entirely possible to build an entire SSI ecosystem with Aries Framework JavaScript. This would use Node.JS as an issuer as a verifier, and uses React Native as a holder.
