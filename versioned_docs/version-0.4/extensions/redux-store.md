# Redux Store

The Redux Store is an implementation of state management that can be used to build React & React Native SSI clients using AFJ.

The Redux Store allows you to integrate state management for the most important parts of using AFJ in a client application (mediation, connections, credentials and proofs), allowing you to sync UI state with the state of the agent as it interacts with other agents through the framework.
