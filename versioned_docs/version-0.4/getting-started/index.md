# Getting started

In this section we will go over everything you need to get started on a technical level. First there are some general prerequisites for Node.JS and React Native. Aries Framework JavaScript works for creating both server-side applications (commonly but not always for creating issuer and verifier agents) and mobile applications (commonly holder agents).

Based on the platform you want to work on, the installation guides you should follow are the same, but some steps may differ.
